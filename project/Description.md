## Recombination process

Global Intermediate Recombination is a method used in evolutionary algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms, for the recombination or crossover process. This method combines traits from multiple parents to create new offspring solutions.

### Understanding Global Intermediate Recombination:

1. **Intermediate Recombination:** 
   - Involves creating offspring by computing a weighted average of the parents' traits. 
   - Typically used with real-valued parameters in genetic algorithms.

2. **Global Aspect:** 
   - "Global" indicates the involvement of more than two parents in the recombination process.
   - The traits of multiple individuals in the population are considered for creating offspring.

3. **Process:** 
   - The offspring's traits are determined by averaging each trait across all selected parents.
   - The formula: 
   - `O_i = (1/N) * Î£(P_{ji})` where `O_i` is the offspring's trait, $P_{ji}$ is the trait in parent `j`, and `N` is the number of parents.

4. **Benefits:** 
   - Helps in maintaining genetic diversity and avoiding premature convergence.
   - Useful for exploring a wide range of solutions in the search space.

5. **Use Cases:** 
   - Often used in continuous optimization problems.

6. **Considerations:** 
   - Risk of diluting high-quality genetic material if too many average parents are included.

7. **Variants:** 
   - Implementations may vary, such as using weighted averages where some parents have more influence based on their fitness.
